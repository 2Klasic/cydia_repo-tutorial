# cydia_repo-tutorial
Warning-..this is not complete as of yet..but the all the files needed are there and ready to go..


In order to create your own repo you will need to have git installed on your mac/linux system

The easiest way would be to install homebrew and then brew install git

Once that is done you will need to git clone this repo

Add your files that you want to push to cydia to the projects folder
  create a folder named DEBIAN
    Inside the DEBIAN folder create a file name control
